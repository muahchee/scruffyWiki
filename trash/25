In computer programming, a code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell#cite_note-6))

## Duck typing

> "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"

Even a non-duck entity that behaves like a duck can be considered a duck because emphasis is on behaviour. By analogy, for computing languages, the type of an object is not important so long as it behaves as expected. ([devopedia](https://devopedia.org/duck-typing#:~:text=Duck%20Typing%20is%20a%20way,methods%2Fattributes%20called%20on%20it.))

## Yoda Conditions

```
// Traditional condition
if (x === "42") {
    // Code to execute if x is the string "42"
}

// Yoda condition
if ("42" === x) {
    // Code to execute if x is the string "42"
}
```

Yoda conditions place the constant before the variable. I guess it sounds like yoda.
