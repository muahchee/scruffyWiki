## Creating unique values with Symbol()

[MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)

A built-in object that returns a Symbol value that guarantees to be unique. Symbols are primitives (like strings or boolean).

> Symbols are often used to **add unique property keys** to an object that won't collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to access the object.

This could be useful for the to-do list project! I could generate unique ids with this!
