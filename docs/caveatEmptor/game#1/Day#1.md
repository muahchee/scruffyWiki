Day #1 
========================

**Georg TÃ¼slingen**. A 64 year old ex-soldier with an amputated right arm. Can usually be seen around town wearing a full military uniform, bragging about their about their past exploits to anyone unfortunate enough to lend an ear.

I caught them staring longingly at the **Cloak of Glory** on display. They weren't wearing their signature uniform. Going out to greet them, the ex-soldier told me that their usual clothes have been damaged by "the King's enemies". I offered to let them try on the cloak. They seem to be interested in the cloak's military green style, but is confused by the intricate snake embroidery.

I applied **Curse Type III : Pedantic** to the cloak. It will restore any body part concealed within it to their former glory.

"Former glory" is based on good memories, and good memories have a tendency to inflate or twist over time. Things always seem grander within the loneliness of one's own mind. Even if the wearer's body is transformed to their perceived ideal, being human, they will inevitably be unsatisfied. The wearer's shifting idea of "former glory" will eventually warp them into a monster. The longer the cloak is worn, they more unwilling the wearer is to remove it, lest they return to their pathetic, lacklustre selves.

Of course, I made sure to let Georg know that the cloak was made in-house by the owner and is impervious to damage!

After putting on the cloak, Georg's posture straightened and they exclaimed that they could feel their right arm. True enough, I could see movement on the right side of the cloak.

It seems that I mistook the ex-soldier for a simple old person with with an ego as fragile as their body. They ripped the cloak off their body and threw it on the ground, before running out the shop screaming "They're here! They've come back for revenge!" Georg is generally dislike in town, no doubt they will just be treated as a lunatic. Though, they do have a fellow ex-soldier who's their sole friend. I'm sure that's nothing worth worrying about.

I will take the cloak for dry-cleaning first thing tomorrow.

**Hermann Camerarius**. A scholar of the occult and bibliophile. Covets esoteric forbidden knowledge, desires the exclusive ownership of it. Came into the shop looking for another addition to their collection. Nothing in our book section seemed to interest them, so I showed them **Io's Writing Tools** - a quill pen and ink set owned by the eponymous late author.

Every single one of Io's books were bestsellers, with subjects ranging from astronomy to philosophy. Each release was dedicated to the author's "divine muse". Io was also known for writing all their manuscripts in ink. After their inexplicable death at 32, a leaked police photo of their corpse went viral. The author was slumped on their desk, left hand loosely gripping the very quill, in the middle of writing a manuscript. Next to the author's head was the inkwell, shaped in the visage of a beautiful stranger, with a morose expression and a dried ink drip down its cheek, mourning the death of its owner.

Io's books were also suddenly banned throughout of the country, giving rise to much speculation surrounding their death. The true nature of the author's "divine muse" was a particularly hot topic. Io had no next of kin, lovers or close friends. Many occultists believe that Io's distinctive writing tools are a medium to communicate with this "divine muse", hence the author's insistence on writing in an archaic way.

Hermann was very familiar with this story. With barely any convincing, they asked for a price.

I applied **Curse Type I : Degree** to the tools. Last week, Duke Murmur requested a collaboration. They wanted us to find a human proxy to write some textbooks for them. I took the opportunity to fulfill this request. I established a link between the writing tools and the Duke's office. When the wielder writes with the quill and ink, they will gain the Duke's deep knowledge of various subjects. The overwhelming knowledge will compell them to write continuously in order to express it. This compulsion will eventually consume the writer.

Hermann will get exclusive access to a "divine muse". I'm not sure if Io's "divine muse" actually existed, but this one definitely does!

Just as Hermann was about to make the impulse purchase, a sudden realisation stopped them. They hold up the tools once more, rotating them while asking themself "...Does this spark joy?" They wound up leaving without purchasing the tools.
