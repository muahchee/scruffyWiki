Notes on the Boss (Mephistopheles)
========================

Handcrafts most of the items in the shop, collects them back when they have been discarded. Is currently away on a collection.

Beautiful and effortlessly charming, the boss makes a sale with ease; me, not so much.

When their in the middle of an "obsession", DO NOT INTERACT!!! YOU WILL BE ANNIHILATED!!! I used to have a co-worker, you know? ...what was their name again?

On the rare occasion the boss is not in the middle of something, they are quite easy to talk to. But remember to not overstay your welcome. Annoying the boss is punishable by death.
