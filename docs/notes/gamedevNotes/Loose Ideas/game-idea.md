Game ideas!
========================

## Till game

You play as a worker at the till, you have to remember customers' names. If you get it wrong, you lose. A memory game. 

Each customer has a unique face. Some are similar. Kind of like [That's Not My Neighbor](https://nachogames.itch.io/thats-not-my-neighbor) or [Papers Please](https://papersplea.se/).

- Player has to type in name
- Player can ask for name, but only for first time customers. Asking repeat customers will result in a penalty.
- Buttons for set answers to questions

> "How are you?"

> ["Good! How are you?] [Thank You!] [Hello!] [Here you go!] [Bye]

- Get new buttons as you progress
- Sometimes customer will ask something unexpected, incapable of answering
