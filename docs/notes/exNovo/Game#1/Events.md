========================
## 1) A hostage is liberated

Settler A and B got into a heated argument and left on bad terms. In revenge, A kidnapped B's child and sent an anonymous letter to B. The letter asked them to publicly humiliate themself in exchange for their child.

B read this letter in the pub and started weeping.

One of The Scholars who was in the town incognito saw this and offered to ehlp. Going agains the Scholars' rules, they used a ritual to pinpoint the child's location and captor. B, now aware of magic's usefulness, no longer holds a stigma against it.

The scholars are displeased. The public display of magic might leak their existence! Though, theya re unaware that the reputation of the arcane has slightly turned for the better in Bandar Esok.

**+1 power to The Scholars**

## 2) Hygiene gains in importance

The Capital's weekly newsletter has just arrived at Bandar Esok. One of the feature articles is a ranking of the cleanest cities in the country, of which Bandar Esok placed dead last. Not willing to accept this humiliation, a town meeting was called. Everybody eventually agree to make resources for personal and public hygience easily accessible.

The guild now stocks cleaning supplies for anyone who needs it. Cleaners are a much more high paying and respected job.

As a monument to this new hygiene craze, a new bathhouse was constructed, with free public baths and private shower stalls, full stocked with toiletries.
