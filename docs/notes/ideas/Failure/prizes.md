On prizes
========================

Quote from pg75 of Joe Moran's If You Should Fail 

<blockquote>

We cling to prizes as proof: the certification that we have spent out time on earth wisely and well. They are the till receipts us failures forgot to ask for at the cash register of life, or were never offered. <span class="italics">This is what I have made of my life...this!</span>

</blockquote>
