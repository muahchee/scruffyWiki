Proteus
========================

[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus)

An **early prophetic sea god** or god of rivers and oceanic bodies of water, one of several deities whom Homer calls the "Old Man of the Sea" (hálios gérôn). 

Some who ascribe a specific domain to Proteus call him the god of "elusive sea change", which suggests the **changeable nature** of the sea or the liquid quality of water. 

**He can foretell the future**, but, in a mytheme familiar to several cultures, **will change his shape to avoid doing so**; he answers only to those who are capable of capturing him.
