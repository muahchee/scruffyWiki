# Books I Enjoy
========================

By "books" I specifically mean books that are majority text. I not an avid reader: I mostly read for research, skimming through pages with a "treasure hunting" mindset. But these books managed to capture me throughout, without needing to dangle "The Answer" as an incentive.

I've noticed that I am more than willing to read about any topic, as long as the writing is approachable and the writer not stuck up their ass.

This list will be dynamic and in no particular order. It will represent my current tastes.
