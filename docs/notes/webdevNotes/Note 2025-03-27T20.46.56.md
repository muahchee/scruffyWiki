## Duck typing

> "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"

Even a non-duck entity that behaves like a duck can be considered a duck because emphasis is on behaviour. By analogy, for computing languages, the type of an object is not important so long as it behaves as expected. ([devopedia](https://devopedia.org/duck-typing#:~:text=Duck%20Typing%20is%20a%20way,methods%2Fattributes%20called%20on%20it.))
