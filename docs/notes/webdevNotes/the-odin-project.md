:material-spear: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
========================

## My little projects

[Odin Recipes](https://muahchee.github.io/odin-recipes/) - My first project!!

[Landing Page](https://muahchee.github.io/landing-page/) - A Yotsuba themed landing page. I missed the days when it was just HTML and CSS...

[Rock Paper Scissors](https://muahchee.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) - My first Javascript project!

[Etch-A-Sketch](https://muahchee.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) - I remember being very proud that I completed all the extra-credit challenges for this project. I learned the power of e.target

[Calculator](https://muahchee.github.io/calculator/) - I was so frustrated with this project that I didn't bother styling it too much. It works pretty well though!

[Sign-up Form](https://muahchee.github.io/sign-up-form/) - Ahh the first of many form I will be making. I finally escaped the foundations course.

[Admin Dashboard](https://muahchee.github.io/admin-dashboard/) - I was meant to use grids for everything, but I wound up using flexbox for one element. Doing this project made me appreciate flexbox. It's nice to have both options in my back pocket.

[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://muahchee.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) - I have a grudge against this project. The bugs were endless... But it turned out fine. This project permanently etched factory functions and closures into my brain.

[Library App](https://muahchee.github.io/library-app/) - App to log books. I didn't know about storage yet, so it isn't actually useful lol

[Restaurant Page](https://muahchee.github.io/restaurant-page/) - My introduction to webpack and OOP!

[Dandori Organiser](https://muahchee.github.io/dandori-organiser/) - A mini-version of the to-do list project.
