## History { .underline }

Ein left Bandar Esok 9 years ago and migrated to New Zealand with their family, giving their old family home to [蕾](1lei.md). Ein still kept in contact with 蕾.

Ein could not adapt to life in a foreign country. No one looked like them, no one spoke like them. No matter how long they stayed, they felt like a perpetual outsider. They resisted the pressure to adapt to their new environment, in fear that they'll have to destroy a part of themself in exchange.

Ein has been texting 蕾 throughout.

On their last year in art school, Ein has a mental breakdown and dropped out. This disappointed everybody who found out, except 蕾, whom at this point is Ein's only friend.

One day, 蕾 offers Ein a place to live in their old childhood home. Ein immediately agrees and makes their way back.

Ein gets caught up in the town's curse and finds out about 蕾's condition.

### [幻颖](1huan-ying.md)

They met on the train Ein took to get to Bandar Esok. 幻颖 returned a bag Ein left on the train. Ever since, Ein wants to be friends with them. Ein sees them as a fellow outsider.

They try not to involve Ein in their mission, but is surprised at how they always meet at the most inconvenient times.

### [蕙伊](1hui-yi.md)

Invited Ein into their store one time after seeing Ein wandering in front of their store. The two of them have a casual friendship. Ein finds their relaxed attitude and lack of ambition comforting and safe. 

They often give Ein tips on where to find 幻颖.

### 年兽    

Like the other residents of Bandar Esok, [Ein is under their influence](../Snippets/restoran-laut-brainstorm.md#The%20story), afflicted with the curse of eternal celebration.

## Misc.

- They're english name 'Ein' comes from the protagonist of [Riviera: The Promised Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera:_The_Promised_Land), which is one of my favourite games. 
- Ein used to be called Einar, but I think Ein sounds cuter.
