## History { .underline }

They used to work as a journalist. Four years before Ein moved back in, 蕾 was involved in a car accident while driving to submit a manuscript. The next thing they knew, they woke up in the [eel clinic](../Locations/eel-clinic.md) naked, they are in a doll version of their body. After the eel nurses "complete" them, they were kicked out of the clinic and the entrance disappered.

When 蕾 returned to the accident site, it had already been cleared out. Cars were driving over the site like it never happened. 

> "I saw my accident in the newspaper, they even included my face! But, for some strange reason, no one seemed to care. Not even when I seemingly came back to life."

> "I tried to get back into my usual routine, but I started to realise that my body wasn't completely the same. I had alot of trouble with simple everyday things. Even got fired because I struggled to write.

They stuggled to adapt until meeting a member of the 绘声社, a group a similarly "resurrected" people. Through the help of their club members, 蕾 got to know more about their ["symptoms"](../Factions/storytelling-club.md#symptoms).

蕾 couldn't decide whether to confide in Ein about their situation, but [Ein eventually found out and accepted 蕾 for who they are](../Snippets/%E5%9B%9E%E4%B9%A1summary.md).

### Ein

蕾’s cousin. Due to Ein's time away before moving back, 蕾 can't actually see how Ein looks like anymore. Nevertheless, they still have a close and comfortable relationship. 蕾 deeply treasures their famlial connection.

蕾 tries their best to call Ein by their new english name rather than "阿珲". Is motivated to keep thier lying impulses under control for Ein's sake.

### Design note
Serves as a contrast to Ein -  Ein yearns to return to the past; Lei has no choice but to live in it.
