## History { .underline }

A civil servant in the deep-sea working in the Missing Persons Department. They were usually deployed locally, but were sent to Bandar Esok with 幻颖 for this particular mission. 蕙伊 has been in the department much longer than 幻颖. They used to be a top performer at their job, excelling at investigation and information gathering, but their performance started to decline when they got bored of the work. 蕙伊 is frustrated because they can't quit, as their boss threatened to blacklist them and prevent them from getting any other job.

Using this mission as their lucky break, they decide to make a living in Bandar Esok, setting up a souvenir shop. 蕙伊 picked up woodworking, using local materials to make their products. Though the shop had no customers at first, business starts to pick up as they formed connections with the locals.

蕙伊 has no intention of returning to the deep-sea.

### [幻颖](1huan-ying.md)

Mission partners and "siblings". Mission siblings.

Despite not being interested in the assigned mission, 蕙伊 often helps 幻颖 work through clues and observations. They feel comfortable around each other and have alot of mutual trust.

蕙伊 is grateful that 幻颖 is supportive of their business and helps out.

### [Ein](1ein.md)

Casual friends. 蕙伊 finds it interesting how Ein is not as affected by the curse compared to the other locals. 

Helps Ein make friends with 幻颖。




### [年兽](beast.md)

蕙伊 is apathetic towards them.

## Magic

### Imbue memories

When carving, 蕙伊 is able to imbue particular memories into the object. When someone holds the imbued object, they get the surrounding feelings of the memory, rather than the memory itself entering their head. It's like that feeling in your chest when you think about your childhood bedroom or grandparents' house.

蕙伊 would often imbue memories they uncover from the locals in the products in the store. This is why people buy things here despite 蕙伊 lack of woodworking skills.

Custom souvenirs are a popular service in the store, where 蕙伊 would sit down and have a chat with the customer while carving.

## Misc.

- 蕙伊 used to have Ein's fringe. I gave Ein their fringe because Ein's hair looked too much like [Handa from Barakamon](https://barakamon.fandom.com/wiki/Sei_Handa) (one of my favourite manga).
