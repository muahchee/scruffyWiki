Restoran Laut brainstorm
========================

Why did I make it?

Because I wanted to make something that reminded me of Malaysia.

Ein walks in on 幻颖 tearing down repeated 福字 in Restoran Makanan Laut Kam Yat (琴日).

---

幻颖 and 蕙伊 are deep-sea people who have come to Bandar Esok to bring back another deep-sea resident - the 年兽。

蕙伊，being self-interested, took this as an opportunity to set a a shop and participate in the local culture, completely ignoring their mission. 

幻颖 is uneasy about this but can't do anything about it. They conduct their own investigation. They are unable to blend in as well as 蕙伊。They can't speak the local language. Deep inside, they feel a twisted pride in not fitting in, on maintaining their 'other-ness'.

蕙伊 is apathetic to the 年兽。

幻颖 is frustrated by the 年兽，they don't like how the beast is influencing and altering the town. 幻颖 spends a significant amount of time trying to clean up its 'messes'.

Ein walks in on 幻颖 'cleaning up'. 

-| Either, The restaurant is usually open of business, but no one is there save 幻颖 and the 福字. Or, its usually closed until the evening, but the shutters are open. Ein wanders in. |-

Is it their first meeting? Maybe not. But Ein and 幻颖 aren't friends yet. Ein recognises 幻颖. 幻颖 doesn't notice Ein coming in.

Ein is also under the influence of the 年兽， but not as much as the locals.

Ein thinks that the 福字 looks festive, is confused why 幻颖 is tearing them down. 幻颖 is unable to communicate effectively. Ein want to be friends, so they are patient and doesnt't dismiss them.

|Ein: "Uhh... Hey!"|

|幻颖 turns around, shocked|

What is the purpose of this scene?

- introducing 幻颖
- 幻颖's mission
- something's wrong with the town (and Ein)
