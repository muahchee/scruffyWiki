绘声社 （The Storytelling Club）
========================
 "We're officially called the "Storytelling Club". "绘声社" is our chinese name. It's from the phrase "绘影绘声”, which means describing something vividly and true to life.

 "It's a little inside joke, courtesy of our beloved president. A pun in plain sight." Lei glaces back at the photograph fondly.

 "I guess in that sense, "resurrection society" is a bit more honest."
 
 ## Symptoms
 
- Senses only work for things recognised and experienced before death
- Anything new cannot be perceived fully
>> "Anything new looks blurry and sounds garbled. My sense of smell and taste also gets messed up. The further away something is from my memory, the less I sense it. It just diminishes until it's just... nothing.
- Hard to experience or express anything new.
- Only exception to these rules is other "resurrected people"
